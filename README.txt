1. In order to effectively display the restaurant information, a header has been added to show the minimum order, restaurant title,
and delivery fee. This has been done so the user can clearly gain information about the restaurant itself.
2. In addition, all of the food products and costs are displayed in a table. A table allows to display the content effectively and 
neatly for the user.
3. Imported fonts has been added to increase the visual appeal of the page.
4. Another design component is the color scheme, which is easy on the eye for the user and displays the content clearly.
